# A Hugo-Powered Site for Ethernet Notes

This [site](https://xintongwang4869.github.io/ethernet-guide/) is a collection of my study and reading notes on Ethernet and networking concepts.


The content is a work in progress â€” I'm still organizing my previous notes, and new content will grow over time.

While this site is primarily designed to introduce Ethernet, future additions may also include PCIe (computer communication and interconnect technologies), as well as Python scripting and web development out of personal interest.


This site uses a template from [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy).
