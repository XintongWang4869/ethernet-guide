Ethernet plays a crucial role in **{{< tooltip text="local area networks (LANs)" key="LAN" >}}**, by connecting **wired** networked devices within **a limited geographical area**.

As you may notice, Ethernet itself does not directly participate in internet connections. Instead, it is a **local** network technology primarily used to facilitate efficient and secure data exchange between devices like computers and printers, serving as the foundation for larger networks, including data centers and internet infrastructure.

To better understand Ethernet and its functionalities, let's explore it through the lens of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model first.
