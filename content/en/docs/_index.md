Welcome to my knowledge base! 

This site is a collection of my study and reading notes on Ethernet and networking concepts, written from the perspective of a technical writer in the semiconductor industry. 
Topics range from Ethernet protocols, interface specifications, and device performance. If you are new to this area, I hope you find these notes helpful!


The content is a work in progress — I'm still organizing my previous notes, and new content will grow over time.
While this site is primarily designed to introduce Ethernet, future additions may also include PCIe (computer communication and interconnect technologies), as well as Python scripting and web development out of personal interest.


If you have any questions or spot any inaccuracies, feel free to [contact me](mailto:email@xintong3248@gmail.com)!
